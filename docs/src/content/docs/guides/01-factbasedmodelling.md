Fact-Based Modelling is a type of conceptual modelling where the key data structure, the fact type, operate over facts.

There are types of Fact-Based Modelling that are graphical in nature and others that are text-based.

Graphical Fact-Based Modelling methodologies include Object-Role Modeling (ORM), Fully Communication Oriented Information Modeling (FCO-IM) and CogNIAM. Text-based Fact-Based Modelling includes the Constellation Query Language.

## What is a Fact?
A fact is a statement that reads like:

“Part ‘123’ is in Bin ‘H2’ in Warehouse ‘Sydney’”

Facts provide data for and structure applicable to what is known as a fact type. The fact above would have a fact type with a fact type reading that reads:

“Part is in Bin in Warehouse”

The reading of a fact type is known as a fact type reading. Fact-Based Modelling models a Universe of Discourse (UoD), which is the subject area under investigation by the model.

Fact-Based Modeling traces its history to the 1970s and was born from a desire to graphically describe the structure of a database that stores the data of facts and incorporate natural language into the mix. FBM’s adoption of natural language within the modelling construct aids in interpretation of the model.
