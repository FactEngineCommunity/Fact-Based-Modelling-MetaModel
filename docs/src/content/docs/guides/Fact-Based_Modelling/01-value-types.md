description: Covers Value Types in Fact-Based Modelling.

A Value Type in Object-Role Modeling represents a domain of values, rather than an Entity Type or Fact Type (association). Value types are used to represent data that does not have a separate existence outside of the object that is related to values of that Value Type.

Value Types represent data of a particular Data Type, such as integers or strings, dates or times. Value Types can also be used to represent things like codes or flags, which may be used to control the behaviour of an object or system.

Value Types range over a domain of data vales and where the name of the Value Type loosely defines the data values of roles played by that value type, within the population of Fact Types. An example Fact Type follows, but first we provide an example Value Type.
