title: Entity Types
description: Covers Entity Types in Fact-Based Modelling.

An Entity Type is a type of object that represents a set of concepts or things that have a separate and distinct existence in the real world. Entity types are used to represent the objects that the system being modelled is concerned with, such as people, organizations, products, or locations.

Each Entity Type is defined by the Roles that it plays in Fact Types that forms its association with other Entity Types, value types or objectified Fact Types. For example, a "Person" Entity Type might have attributes such as "Name," "Date Of Birth," and "Address," and play roles in Fact Types such as "Person is employee of Company" or "Person is spouse of Person" that describe the person's association with other Entity Types.

One of the best way to think of the Entity Types of FBM is to relate them to the use of nouns in everyday language. In general, whatever you would normally associate as being a noun, (e.g. ‘Person’), will translate to an Entity Type within FBM. As nouns are used in natural language, Entity Types are designed in FBM to represent a broad set of things or objects . In the same way as the word ‘Person’ does not represent any one person, an Entity Type represents a broad class of individual Entities. 

NB In Object-Role Modeling we speak of sets of individuals rather than a Class   of individuals.

The instances of Entity Types can be thought of as things that are identified by their relationship to other things. For instance, any one particular person may be identified by their first and last names.
