title: Constraints (Role/Value Constraints)
description: Covers Constraints in Fact-Based Modelling.
---

Fact-Based Modelling uses constraints to restrict the values that may fill the place holders of Roles within Fact Types. The majority of symbols in the FBM graphical notations are dedicated to constraints and it is the extent of the vocabulary of constraint symbols that add significantly to the expressiveness of FBM.

Certain languages are tailor made for specific purposes. For example, whole dictionaries are dedicated to the vocabulary of medicine, the stock-market, the mining industry, information technology. Each of those professions has their own unique vocabulary. The vocabulary of FBM is tailor made for a specific task, and indeed, that task is to define a Universe of Discourse in sufficient detail and clarity such that the reader (or interpreter) of an FBM model has very little chance of misinterpreting what the author was expressing at the time of creating the FBM model . When looked at from that perspective (the reader, not the writer of a message), it probably becomes very clear the need for as many useful and logically sound constraints as is possible. Fact-Based Modelling certainly provides those.

As a play on words, it might be said that “FBM has its constraints”. And that is true. As with any language, there is an upper limit to what you can say with FBM, and “words may fail you”. On the whole, though, the constraint lexicon of Fact-Based Modelling is larger than many other graphical conceptual modelling languages. If ever you cannot express yourself in FBM, like most conceptual modelling languages, FBM allows the use of annotation in natural language to refine a model (Model Notes).  

## Constraints and Role Constraints  

Nearly every constraint in Fact-Based Modelling is a Role Constraint, meaning that because all constraints are over data instances, the constraint is defined as applying to the data for Roles played by Object Types.
