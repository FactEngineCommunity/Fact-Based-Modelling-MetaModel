title: Appendix B – Outstanding FBM Constructs
description: Lists FBM constructs not yet covered by the exchange schema.

The source document records constructs that remain unsupported:

- **Role Value Constraints** – Constrain the data values that can be stored for a Role (E.g. In sample populations (Facts) for a particular role inside the `FactData` element.)

Additional constructs will be documented in future revisions as the schema evolves.
