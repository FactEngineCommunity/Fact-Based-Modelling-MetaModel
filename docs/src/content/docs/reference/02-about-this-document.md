description: Outline of the FBM Exchange MetaModel XSD reference scope and related file extensions.
---

## Overview

This reference describes the XML Schema Definition (XSD) that supports exchanging Fact-Based Models (FBM) between tools. The schema captures modelling approaches such as Object-Role Modeling (ORM) and related identification structures highlighted throughout the document.

### Identification

Fact-Based Models that conform to the schema are distributed using the `.fbm` file extension.

### Other extensions

Additional XML artefacts that comply with the same schema may also be delivered with a generic `.xml` extension when required.

### XSD version number

The source XSD document identifies XSD version **V1.2** for the `.fbm` exchange format, with this documentation repository providing revisions as they are made.
