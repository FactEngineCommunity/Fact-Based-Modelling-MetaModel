- **20150510-VM** – Clifford to provide additional commentary on the topic.
- **20150511-CH** – Email response with examples:
  - CQL illustration: `either Employee participates in company-Superannuation or that Employee has personal-Superannuation;` (both may hold, but at least one must).
  - Example diagram referenced at <http://dataconstellation.com/ActiveFacts/examples/images/Genealogy.png>, highlighting a four-way disjunctive mandatory constraint and its link to disjunctive identification.
